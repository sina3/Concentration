# Concentration

This is the first demo project from the [CS193p](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/) course "Developing Apps for iOS" at Stanford taught by *Paul Hegarty*.

This app is a well-known memory game where you have to remember card locations to match the pairs.

* The code here is a little different from what the final code written by Paul in the course. I have taken the liberty to customize it and give it a somewhat different look.
